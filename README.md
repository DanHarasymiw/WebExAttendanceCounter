# WebExAttendanceCounter
In "My Reports" under "My WebEx" you can view a list of reports of each WebEx conference you created. Clicking on one of
these brings you to a page where you can export the report as a .csv file. This program reads in all of the csv reports
in the directory "reports/" and finds out how many times that a user joined any of these conferences, and the dates that
they attended.
